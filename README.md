## What Is This? 
Get, Show, and Style a Class Roster via our API data

* Dynamically list content from an API data source
* Seperate the data from the design
* Use JS template literals for templating
* `fetch` a JSON data endpoint from Webflow
* Apply foundations of a _headless CMS_

## API Endpoint
Here is link to the API endpoint for the _Collection_ for roster Spring 2022 Students.

## Why Does This Exist? 
Webflow (and many others) have a no-code CMS, and GUI for designing the templates. Webflow (and many others) also have an API that is accessible as a _headless CMS_.
